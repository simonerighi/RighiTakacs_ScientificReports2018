This project contains the script and data to reproduce the results of model discussed in Righi S., Takacs K. (2018) "Social Closure and the Evolution of Cooperation via Indirect Reciprocity", Scientific Reports.

It is possible to re-run all the simulations used in the paper launching RUN_ALL_SIMULATIONS.m . Be advised however that the involved simulations may take very long to run (in the order of few months), especially on non massively multi-core machines. 

If you reproduced the simulations with RUN_ALL_SIMULATIONS.m or you just want to reproduce the figures you should:
(1)- put all .m files in the same folder
(2)- in the same folder place all .mat files of this project.
(3)- launch:
	(3a) Figures_MainText to reproduce all the figures in the main text of  Righi, Takacs 2018, Scientific Reports.
	(3b) SI_Figures_All.m to reproduce all the figures in the supplementary information of  Righi, Takacs 2018, Scientific Reports.

The model detailed description is contained in the article Righi S., Takacs K. (2018) "Social Closure and the Evolution of Cooperation via Indirect Reciprocity", Scientific Reports.
